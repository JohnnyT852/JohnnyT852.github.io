<p style=text-align:center;>My name is Jonathan Torres, I am a current freshman at San Jose State University. The major I am currently studying for is a major in digital art and in this portfolio are all my projects I have done for my major so far. (Don't ask why I chose this image as my cover, I don't know)</p>
